of the “Princess Cave Run” Development </B>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">This
is the game that is based on the arcade type, that is popular
nowadays, and specifically – on that of runner. This was the first
serious game which we decided to support all along and make it
interesting to the maximum. And for that we could not enter the
marker only with pretty graphics. Game control is out of the question
as it was just like in the typical arcade. Game should be stuffed
with effects, be emotionally comfortable and atmospheric. And even
here development and design of the game could not be performed
without the inspiration which we draw from the other game.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">About
the difficulties of realization I have already written in the
previous article, so I will not repeat myself in many moments. We
were limiting ourselves with mobile platforms and 2D design. A good
arcade did not necessarily required 3D design, so our success was
fully dependent from our conjoined efforts.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">The
mail difficulty was pass on to the designer, and from the point of
view of the majority and my own, this is the most important moment of
the game. Early on we throw off the importance of the unique
character of the game, because it was not going to be unique in the
mechanics. I will start with the work of the designer, and here is
the example of a beautiful game banner:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="{% static 'stories/Princess_Run_Story/i_ac3b5ff07d654083_html_361c767f.jpg' %}" NAME="image11.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=12 VSPACE=12 WIDTH=602 HEIGHT=293 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Work with the designer</B></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">We
were basing on the good old “Tilt Monsters”. It is shown on the
image below.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="{% static 'stories/Princess_Run_Story/i_ac3b5ff07d654083_html_4f849cb1.jpg' %}" NAME="image06.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=12 VSPACE=12 WIDTH=497 HEIGHT=353 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Vertical lane was moving
and the little and the big monsters with different effects, extra
points, bombs and so on appeared. The aim of the game is to score
more points when dodging obstacles by moving to the left and to the
right. The game looked very funny and simple. We wanted to rework
this idea with new realistic design and more interesting effects. But
in the total we did not manage to realize all that.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">The
new designer who has just started to work was incredibly talented.
But up to the release of the game we could not get what we wanted to.
There were lots of sketches that we needed to fit in the certain idea
and atmosphere. On the practice it was not resulting well. First
working game prototype we coped to make in only a few days. This was
not looking so harmonically and atmospherically as we wanted it to.
The example of realization can be seen on the picture below:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="{% static 'stories/Princess_Run_Story/i_ac3b5ff07d654083_html_35e59ca8.jpg' %}" NAME="image08.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=12 VSPACE=12 WIDTH=602 HEIGHT=360 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Charitably
speaking this did not answer our interests. I can speak on graphical
problems longer, but it was not the issue of designer’s
potentialities, it was rather the problem of understanding. It was
hard to get out a message, and frequently in such situations I wished
to turn into a designer myself.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Another
problem is the proper inspiration. Usually when you show to the
designers works of other developers you would like to give the
fantasy the right flow and create something pretty and unique. But
usually such attempts did not have the proper impact. Another people
(in our case - designer) took these shown games too closely and in
the result of this their works were partially copied. In other words,
they did not get inspired, but simply reworked what they have seen.
Therefore the process of design development was always under control
in order to keep it in the safe zone.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Untimely stoppage of the game and
final</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Currently
the hero of our game is Princess and she is just running and
collecting crystals, escaping from the little monsters. But we
planned to animate the monsters and the heroine to the smallest
details, to add lots of elements like sparkling heel, trampolines,
the development of tracks and levels. In the game shop you could buy
clothes for your hero, chose his style to your taste and many other.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">In
the end we got from the designer the approximate model of what we
wanted to see. But nevertheless what we have in the game is not more
than 20% of what we have planned. It is just one game level that you
can endlessly pass. It is simple flow of tracks with different
styles. The addition of Google LeaderBoard, <SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Achievements,
Google Ads. That is all that we managed to realize for one month,
before the game was untimely stopped and we were asked to publish it
on the unfinished stage. In fine, here are the example of the game:</SPAN></P>
