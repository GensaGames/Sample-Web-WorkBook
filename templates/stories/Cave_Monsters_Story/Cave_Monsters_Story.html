Monsters” Game Development</B></h2></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> <h3><B>Preface</B></h3></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Actual
story of the game began later after the appearance of the first
thoughts. We wanted to create not just a game, but an entire
atmosphere, and for that we needed to imagine a game not only on the
basis of “something new”. And creation of that “new” was
taking from us lots of time and getting us away from the primary aim
– creation of a good game.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">“Everything
new is well-forgotten old” perfectly suits this story. This game
can hardly surprise you with its interface or control system.  But it
is that kind of a game, entering which, you find yourself being
totally in the game. This is called the atmosphere and it is a very
important point when creating a game. But here we have two sides of a
medal again. On the one hand, there are games to be preferred while
being in the subway or standing in a line, these are, as a rule,
simple games like three in a row. On the other hand, when you come
home, get yourself comfortable on a sofa and open this very
atmosphere that we are talking about. I will tell you more about
mobile development later in the article.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">There
is one serious point that was limiting us a lot - 2D design. Why?
Here we can give several serious arguments. First one - mobile
platforms. Creating a game for a year, then optimizing it for mobile
platforms for a long time, and then cut off a serious number of
audience (because of the insufficient power of the all the devices)
became a reasonable point. Second – lack of a strong 3D designer
and designer of appropriate textures. The first thing to occur to a
fretful user is that 2D is something imperfect. But this thought
instantly melts away when you look at such game legends as “Limbo”,
which is on the picture below.</SPAN></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">It
was nominated for the best design among 3D graphics competitors, and
this was inspiring me by the end of project. By the way, did you
notice that it has only two colors – white and shades of grey? Will
you find something new in the game? No. Will you be surprised by the
new game control? No, but will you say that this game is a bad one? 
I think no, even if you did not play it. And here we get an important
conclusion which is applicable not only to the sphere of game
development, but to life in general. Nothing but your own imagination
and creativity limits you. And I had a wish to give my fantasy a
life…</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Positive
moment is the creation of a team. Since company had more than one
programmer I had to get a companion for cooperative development. But
in the end I volunteered to work alone which played a crucial role in
the game design. On the one hand, team-work allows you to analyze
your creations from a different point of view. But on the other one,
working on your own provides your fantasy with no limits.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B><h3><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff"> What to start with?</SPAN></h3></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">I
have partially mentioned that the main complexity of work with mobile
platforms is 2D design. Among other factors, which make the aim to
drag the player into our reality more difficult, are small screens.
And though it is not already such a great problem after 20 mins in
the game, at the beginning it really is. Here appears a problem for
designer. There should be lots of elements, but they should not drag
attention from the main hero away. The importance of the background
could not be overrated, though at the first sight it is not an
element of primary importance.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Very
soon I will return to the background, but for the fullness of picture
I want to come up from the other side.  Now I would like to ask you
to imagine well-known game “Mario”. It is a typical platformer,
when a hero stands on a platform - let it be ground. When you look at
the threshold of the game, when he is running on such platforms, you
begin to conscious one effect – the ground under him is not simply
a picture, where he is moving. It is a special zone on which we build
up a peculiar imagination of a ground in our fantasy, our fantasy
moves away from the 2D model.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Moving
on. Some elements, e.g. trees, are situated on the foreground in the
reference to the hero. In such a way the hero is blanked out when
passing through these elements, and again in our mind we create the
comprehension of such objects that are not 2D for our fantasy and
they begin to play the part of fully-valid things. This interplay of
game world is very important for our atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">You
can and you need to interact with the world in various ways. Each
move of the hero should create more of such elements. That is why the
background should become such an element of perception. When you walk
along the street the motion of the trees in the background is not
still or running with you, but slightly moving to your side. In the
development this effect is called parallax.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">As
an example we can take the same street with buildings: trees on the
background are moving with one speed, lamppost (which is also a part
of the background) is moving with another and so on. In practice this
looks something like on the picture below.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: -0.02in; margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG STYLE="display:block; margin:auto;" SRC="{% static 'stories/Cave_Monsters_Story/i_b0d8b92c3ba5c0aa_html_b1b38f80.jpg' %}" NAME="image12.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=12 VSPACE=12 WIDTH=598 HEIGHT=305 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Each
layer creates its own part in the user’s perception. The motion of
clouds would be slow even if the hero is standing still, and fast,
when he is going. The sun would shine brighter and greater if only it
is not covered with clouds. The motion of mountains will be extremely
slow and the land on the background would move a bit slower than the
hero.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Such
games as “</SPAN>Nightmare: Malaria” и “Anoxemia” are
Android and iOS games that perfectly managed to create multilayer
parallax. They are successively shown on the pictures.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: -0.02in; margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG STYLE="display:block; margin:auto;" SRC="{% static 'stories/Cave_Monsters_Story/i_b0d8b92c3ba5c0aa_html_74e7e894.jpg' %}" NAME="image17.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=12 VSPACE=12 WIDTH=602 HEIGHT=338 BORDER=0></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">After
the short period of code implementation I already had resources to
work with multilayer parallax. It was only the problem of design that
stayed and which, clearly, I could not do. But the artist issue I
will keep to the end.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><h3><B>I want to move this wall!</B></h3></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">One
more moment about which all the users are dreaming is the maximal
world interaction. To move something you cannot move and to stroke
something you cannot stroke. Maximal interaction is just what I
wanted to create in the game. Movement of a hero makes the grass
fluctuate under his feet. You could drag any brick by the road, shake
a tree until it falls, to dig the soil in any possible place and so
on. I wanted nothing to stop the hero and I knew how to do it. The
only thing that suffered from such a total interact was the game size
about which we will be speaking later. By using standard methods all
these continued being highly-functioning and easy to access on mobile
devices.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Total
world interact allows to solve one and the same problem in different
ways. Freedom of problemsolving!  This is not throwing of birds in
the same direction in order to destroy a construction. It is a
throwing of trotyl-stuffed birds with jet engines and start-buttons
right into a desired location. Do you feel the difference?</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">One
more example that makes this moment hard to overestimate is called
“Machinarium”. It is really incredible game well-known to all.
Your aim in the game on its every stage is to find and solve the
problem: to find the way out of the room, to reach the other side of
a cliff by using all the means available. As a rule each problem has
only one solving. But why not to get out of the room by crawling
through the window, breaking or bursting the door open? To reach
another side of a cliff by bulking lots of junk on its bottom or to
jump it over with a pole?</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">I
think I have succeeded in the explanation my aim. And all these were
exactly what I wanted to implant in the game. It would be total
freedom of action, limited by the level of the game, where each new
level would open something uniquely new in the behavior or action of
a hero.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><h3><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff"> <B>Why the game weights more than 2 MB?</SPAN></h3></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Now
we reached another limiting moment in the process of game development
for mobile platforms. At the same time game size is important and
not. Not long ago game popularity was partially dependent from actual
game size. And it is more likely that a user will download 10 games
of 2 MB than 1 of 20 MB. And nowadays situation is the same and this
factor is not going to lose its importance quickly. But as the
technologies develop in a crazy pace we can get an indulgence.  Speed
of the internet in public networks (from 20 to 100 Mbit\s) today
allows downloading games with huge sizes.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">On
the other side, is it possible for a good game with long and
interesting story to be 20 MB? Not likely. And users partially begin
to understand this.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Second
technological moment – performance capabilities of new devices.
Mobile performance is disputable and interesting moment and we will
not touch it yet. Another thing is that phone memory opens us wide
horizons. Capabilities of modern smartphones vary from 4 to 128 GB.
Models with small internal memory (usually these are models with 4 to
8 GB of built-in memory) allow using external drives like small USB
flash drives. All these give us the second indulgence: - modern (and
not really) smartphones have quite big memory even for the storage of
huge files.</SPAN></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Now
we are going to speak about light. Nobody argues that it is very
important for 3D. More than that – I will not be speaking about it
if I was not dealing with that sort of games. But is there something
to tell about it in relation to 2D games?</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">To
start with do you meet lots of 2D games that use light and especially
on mobile devices? There are too little of them because it is the
question of performance and many people just decide to discard it
usually underestimating this moment. Pay your attention to the
picture below:</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: -0.02in; margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG STYLE="display:block; margin:auto;" SRC="{% static 'stories/Cave_Monsters_Story/i_b0d8b92c3ba5c0aa_html_6f8ed750.jpg' %}" NAME="image14.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=12 VSPACE=12 WIDTH=602 HEIGHT=311 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Is
not the comprehension of the cubes is building up here? The
three-dimensional effect is being created and we feel their
completeness. Our consciousness is not limited by the fact that it is
just a picture on the screen. We enter this comprehension and this
atmosphere. This is one more moment of development that took a lot of
time to find the resources needed.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">After
more than one day of tries to create and reproduce something similiar
(and there are a lot of such stuff on the internet) it became quite
possible to make something like this. There is one big flaw
represented on the picture above. As you can see all the shadows are
sharp and not blurred. Another example of such poor shadow you can
see on the other picture:</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: -0.02in; margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG STYLE="display:block; margin:auto;" SRC="{% static 'stories/Cave_Monsters_Story/i_b0d8b92c3ba5c0aa_html_3c765206.jpg' %}" NAME="image13.jpg" ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=12 VSPACE=12 WIDTH=602 HEIGHT=396 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">You
may say that this problem is easily solved by adding a blurring
effect on a certain layer (where the actual shadow is). But how will
this filter influence game performance? Very deplorably I may say. So
the next problem that I faced was a good camera shader to solve the
problem. There were several solutions and I managed to find a good
camera shader that blurred the shadow in the right way, but it also
blurred the background on which the shadow was depicted. And it was
absolutely not what I needed! This shader worked logically– shadow
was depicted on a certain layer so the background is to be on that
layer too.  </SPAN>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">Here,
luckily, works of a very talented man came in handy. It was indie
developer named Jake (to whom I am incredibly thankful) and his work
entitled </SPAN>VLS2D Light. He answered all my questions with his
developments the results of which I will show soon.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">This
is not a complete game. And I would really like to tell you about it
being successful, but it is another story. The game did not find
sustenance and there no time to make it perfect.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">More
than that, we decided that the main person in such a development is
surely a designer. Only due to design, general plan, game idea you
may enter the great world of game industry.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">We
have no game story or at least one resource made by designer. There
is nothing, and everything that I used was simply found on the
Internet. I would like to represent a game with bright future, but I
cannot do it for this time.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffffff">There
are only three screenshots of short work and great hope. Development
took only a fortnight, but there existed a game idea for long years.
