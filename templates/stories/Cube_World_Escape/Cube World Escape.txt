Development history of this game began with the idea to make a 3D game for mobile platforms. We liked this idea because 3D games attract almost everybody with their vividness, game world and atmosphere. We faced the problem of choosing game genre and game scenario. As it was out first experience of game development and considering the lack of time, we decided to choose a puzzle game. We wanted a user to think, but also to get lots of positive emotions and joy each time he makes a right choice.
