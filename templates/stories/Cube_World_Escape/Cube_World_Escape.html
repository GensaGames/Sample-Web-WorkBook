World Escape” Development</B></P>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Development
history of this game began with the idea to make a 3D game for mobile
platforms. We liked this idea because 3D games attract almost
everybody with their vividness, game world and atmosphere. We faced
the problem of choosing game genre and game scenario. As it was out
first experience of game development and considering the lack of
time, we decided to choose a puzzle game. We wanted a user to think,
but also to get lots of positive emotions and joy each time he makes
a right choice.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Today
there are already created a lot of various puzzle games. There are
real hits among them – “Three in a Row”, «Monument Valley»,
«The Room» and so on. This only proved our conviction that such
kind of games is really popular – people like to play them a lot.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Creation of game plot and game logic</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Having
chosen genre and idea we started to create a plot. Scenario of a
puzzle-game is not very vivid and original and lies in proper
distribution of game quests for a player. You need to gradually
increase complexity of quests with the progression of the game. After
some discussions and looking at the examples of some puzzle-games we
decided to make a parallelepiped our main hero. Gameplay itself was
in positioning that parallelepiped vertically on a finish platform by
successively upturning it through the level map. If a player succeeds
– level is passed. If a player falls off the platform the level is
failed. There will be a possibility to restart that level or to
return to the menu to choose another level (only out of the opened
ones) to go. Gameplay turned out to be extremely simple. Main point
is complexity and attractiveness of levels, which according to the
plan should attract a player on their own by continuously challenging
him one level after another. Next task was to organize game logic and
mechanics in order to reach the main effect of the game which is to
make a player feel comfortable while making a choice and a number of
choices and, as a result, combinations of game passing were not
limited at all. We wanted to make a game that had only one right
solution to complete a level, but a player could have an unlimited
choice from a great number of different variants.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Some
discussions took place when choosing a points gaining system. In the
process we stopped at the following. In the process player was
awarded by a certain number of stars. Game aim is to complete a level
with the maximal number of stars. Number of stars awarded for the
level completion is counted out of the minimal number of moves (for
each level particularly).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">3 stars - min =&lt; c &lt;
(min + 5%)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2 stars - (min + 6%) &lt;
c &lt; (min + 15%)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1 star - (min + 16%) &lt;
c &lt; (min + 30%)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">0 stars - (min + 31%) &lt;
c &lt; infinity</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Where:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">min - minimal number of
moves on this level</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">c - number of moves made
by a player</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For example:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On 16 level minimal
number of moves (min) equals 63.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In order to get:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">3 stars - number of moves
made by a player (с) from 63 to 67</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2 stars - number of moves
made by a player (с) from 68 to 73</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1 star - number of moves
made by a player (с) from 74 to 82</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">0 stars - number of moves
made by a player (с) from 83 to infinity</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Game design</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Considering
that in this game design plays a crucial role, we decided to regard a
design question as one of the most important ones. We required design
that could not only emphasize, but also increase player’s
impression from the game itself. At the same time it should be clear
to a player on a hunch. The first variant of game’s design appeared
instantly. The game should be made in old Egyptian style. Or as in
films where main characters try to reach the tomb – “Lara Croft”,
“Indiana Jones”, etc. While doing this, heroes solve puzzles and
look for the keys. The first design looked like this:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="{% static 'stories/Cube_World_Escape/i_4a6c82bcd011bd66_html_5b90d4d3.jpg' %}" NAME="image14.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=12 VSPACE=12 WIDTH=272 HEIGHT=194 BORDER=0>
           
<IMG SRC="{% static 'stories/Cube_World_Escape/i_4a6c82bcd011bd66_html_3ab3c570.jpg' %}" NAME="image11.png" ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=12 VSPACE=12 WIDTH=272 HEIGHT=194 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">After
estimating the design we decided that it does not suit us. For this
game we need minimalistic design that is not spoiling the general
impression. Perhaps, this design did not create the atmosphere
according to the initial idea. The second variant of the design
became final and it is futuristic. It makes game design and UI design
look naturally.</P>
